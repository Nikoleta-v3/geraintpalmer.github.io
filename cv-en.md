## Education

# October 2014 - Present

PhD in Mathematics, Cardiff University.  
Supervisors: Prof. Paul Harper & Dr. Vincent Knight

This is a project in Operational Research, where I am researching queueing networks and their applications to healthcare systems. So far the work has focused on open restricted queueing networks and their deadlocking properties. A method of detecting when deadlock occurs in computer simulations of queueing networks using state digraphs was found, and Markov models of deadlocking queueing networks built.

In addition, the [ASQ (ASQ Simulates Queues)](https://github.com/geraintpalmer/ASQ) project was started and continues to grow. This is a Python library for simulating open queueing networks. The project will progress to look at how reinforcement learning algorithms within simulation models can be used to help make decisions in a healthcare setting.

# October 2013 - October 2014

MSc Operational Research and Applied Statistics, Cardiff University.

Here taught modules gave me an overview of operational research techniques including queueing theory, game theory, simulation, mathematical programming and heuristics. Statistical techniques learned include parametric and non-parametric hypotheses testing, and use of SPSS.
I completed my dissertation at the University of Twente in the Netherlands on an Erasmus placement.

Dissertation title: *Optimising surgery schedules in order to increase operating room utilisation and level beds in the PACU and holding area.*

# September 2010 - May 2013

BSc Mathematics, Aberystwyth University. First Class Honours.

# September 2008 - June 2010

Ysgol Gyfun Cymer Rhondda

A-levels: Mathematics (A*), Physics (A), Chemisty (A)

## Skills

Python, LaTeX, VBA, Excel, SPSS. I am currently learning to build web applications using Django. I hold a full, clean driving license. Fluent in both English and Welsh.

## Other

I assist with lab sessions and marking for various modules of the MSc, undergraduate operational research modules, and the Computing for Mathematics module. I am also a maths and stats support tutor. I have also translated some materials from English to Welsh, such as class tests and coursework.

I was a co-steam-organiser of the Stochastic Modelling Stream at the Young OR 19 in Aston. I was member of the organising committee for [DjangoCon Europe 2015, Cardiff](http://2015.djangocon.eu/).

I am a member of [The UK OR Society](https://www.theorsociety.com).
